# Funlax eCommerce

Funlax eCommerce is an online company that sells fidget toys to kids aged 6-12 and people of any age with anxiety or stress. We use Long Tail Marketing (LTM) to target niche markets and use social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook to promote our products.

## Pricing Strategy

Our pricing strategy is a combination of cost-based and psychological pricing. Cost-based pricing involves setting the price of our products based on the costs involved in producing and distributing them. To determine the cost-based price, we calculate the total costs of production, including materials, labor, and overhead, and add a markup to cover our profit margin. Psychological pricing involves setting prices in a way that influences the perceived value of the product in the mind of the customer. For example, we may use odd-number pricing, such as $19.99, to make the price appear more attractive to customers.

## Payment Methods

We accept credit/debit cards and PayPal as payment methods. However, there are potential pitfalls associated with each of these options. For example, PayPal is vulnerable to fraud. To minimize the risk of fraudulent activity, we implement fraud prevention measures such as requiring strong passwords and using two-factor authentication. Additionally, if a customer disputes a charge made through PayPal, we may be subject to a chargeback, which can be costly for merchants. To minimize the risk of chargebacks, it is important for us to clearly communicate our return policy and handle customer complaints promptly.

In addition to fraud and chargebacks, PayPal charges a fee for each transaction that is processed through its system. These fees can add up over time and can be a significant cost for merchants. To minimize the impact of transaction fees, we carefully review the fees associated with using PayPal and consider using other payment methods, such as credit card processing, if they offer more favorable fees. Finally, some customers may not have a PayPal account or may not be comfortable using the system for online payments. To accommodate the needs of all of our customers, we offer a variety of payment options, including credit card processing and alternative payment methods.

## E-Commerce Website

To create a good eCommerce website, we consider several key features. A user-friendly design is essential, with a clean and uncluttered layout and intuitive navigation. The website should also provide clear information about the products being sold, including detailed descriptions and high-quality images. In addition, the checkout process should be secure, with options for different payment methods and easy-to-follow instructions. Other important considerations include mobile responsiveness, fast loading times, and a clear return policy. Overall, a good eCommerce website should provide a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience for customers.
